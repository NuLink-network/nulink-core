The Vision For Twisted
======================





Many other documents in this repository are dedicated to
defining what Twisted is. Here, I will attempt to explain not
what Twisted is, but what it should be, once I've met my goals
with it.

    


First, Twisted should be fun. It began as a game, it is
being used commercially in games, and it will be, I hope, an
interactive and entertaining experience for the end-user.

    


Twisted is a platform for developing internet applications.
While Python by itself is a very powerful language, there are
many facilities it lacks which other languages have spent great
attention to adding. It can do this now; Twisted is a good (if
somewhat idiosyncratic) pure-python framework or library,
depending on how you treat it, and it continues to improve.

    


As a platform, Twisted should be focused on integration.
Ideally, all functionality will be accessible through all
protocols. Failing that, all functionality should be
configurable through at least one protocol, with a seamless and
consistent user-interface. The next phase of development will
be focusing strongly on a configuration system which will unify
many disparate pieces of the current infrastructure, and allow
them to be tacked together by a non-programmer.
