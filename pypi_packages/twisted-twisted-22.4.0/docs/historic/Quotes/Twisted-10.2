<glyph> khorn: "I know what you're thinking.  'Did he add six callbacks or only five?'  Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I kind of lost track myself.

<disappearedng> since twisted has wsgi handler I thought it might be possible that I attach engine to reactor and then in my django code call reactor.engine.foo ..
<exarkun> Twisted's solution is to have functions that take arguments.  Because that's Python's solution.  And it sort of actually works most of the time.
<exarkun> The problem you're having is that Django's functions _don't_ take arguments.
<exarkun> Because Django apparently doesn't think that you'd ever need anything except your database connection, which you can get from your config file.
<disappearedng> come again?
<exarkun> Let's say you have an object `o`
<exarkun> And you have a function `f`
<exarkun> And `f` needs `o` in order to operate properly
<exarkun> The correct solution is `f(o)`

<spiv> exarkun: "I know I'll use floating point.  Now you have 2.0000000000000001 problems"?

<PenguinOfDoom> Software is done not when there is nothing to add, but when the developer is sick and tired of wrestling with windows

<exarkun> OpenSSL is the original failfest
