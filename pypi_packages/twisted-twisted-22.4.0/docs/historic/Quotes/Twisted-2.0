<glyph> people would just roll dice all the time in chat rooms
<glyph> for *no reason*
<glyph> because it was a feature of the system that was added for RPG players
<glyph> and the dice-rolling syntax was pretty involved
<glyph> infinitely involved, actually
<glyph> it was a complete RainMan interpreter
<glyph> you could backdoor the whole goddamn system with the dice roller
<glyph> user: "I'd like to roll some very big dice"
<glyph> system: "sure, maybe you would like an admin console and some dev tools to help you manage them"

<brian_> I'm pretty sure from twisted import __version__ will work
<slyphon> or i guess you could do that
<brian_> I import dictionaries
<slyphon> really? do you have to declare them in customs?

%
<Karnaugh> my attempt at implementing Ramanujan went horribly wrong
<Vhata> because Python isn't the best language for reincarnating tubercular indians?
%
<Vhata> maybe I should write my own operating system, where you CAN write to sockets
<Vhata> my operating system will have beer and hookers, too
<Vhata> in fact, screw the sockets

<arg> i think a significant percentage of twisted apps begin as the logbot example
<chrchr> Twisted is a fantastic framework for building logbots.

<mumak> hmm. I think my flatmate is asleep.
<Brend> You should take this opportunity to glue all the furniture to the ceiling
<mumak> Brend: well, I have to live here too 
<mumak> Brend: and besides, I'm on holidays. That sounds like too much work.
<Brend> If you just glue your flatmate to the ceiling, you achieve the same thing with less work, and no impedence to yourself!
<mumak> you present a strong and compelling case
<mumak> however, I think my flatmate wouldn't appreciate it.
<Brend> Anyone who can't see the value of being glued to the ceiling deserves punishment by ceiling-glue

<hypatia> Hey, hidden bonus of having actual named maintainers is having
          people to assign bugs to...
<hypatia> Of course, it always ends up being exarkun anyway.
