<mingus> it's exactly all the things i wanted vim to be but never was
<glyph> mingus: the sad part is, it's exactly all the things bram wanted vim to be but never was; vim is the trophy of ignorance's triumph over laziness
<glyph> but hey, it's, uh, faster to start

<dash> slyphon: sure, but this has happened before

<slyphon> why is it that when women get pms and they give you a hard time about nothing that the _LAST_ thing on _EARTH_ you can suggest to them is that they might be the teensiest, weensiest bit on edge because they have PMS?
<Yosomono> slyphon: Because you are basically telling them that their feelings are the result of chemical imbalance, and therefore unimportant.
<slyphon> BUT THEY ARE!
<saph_w> slyphon: because it belittles what they're feeling to being simply a hormonal response
<Yosomono> slyphon: Good luck buddy.

<Yosomono> dash: It should be a standard feature of the con.
<dash> Yosomono: Maybe so.
<Yosomono> dash: This is the year 2004 for cripesake.
<saph_w> Yosomono: maybe the japs should give us our fucking flying cars, then we'll talk about streaming video!

<jml> there's a book out called 'implementing CIFS'
<jml> anyone want to buy it for me?

<phobos> but like, when you were 16-22, (maybe you still are), most sexual contact you obtained was through just 'hooking up', i.e. meeting someone at a party, stoned and/or drunk, and doing things for the night only, right?
<maciej> phobos:  no, most sexual contact I obtained was with myself
<maciej> and that was a long-term relationship

<radix> it's stupid
<slyphon> it is?
<radix> the proper solution is to use an alternative implementation of time

<radix> So, I guess the reason you chose ftp as a discovery protocol is because it's a semi-ubiquitous anonymous protocol that allows people to communicate?
