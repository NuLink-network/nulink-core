    A `RecordField` represents a field as part of a record in the datastore.

    The field is given a type via `field_type`. Additionally, a `RecordField`
    has three optional parameters: `encode`, `decode`, and `query_filter`.

    The `field_type` is the Python type that the field should be when being
    accessed from the datastore.

    The optional `encode` is any callable that takes the field value (as a
    `field_type`) as an argument and returns it as `bytes`. This should always
    be implemented if the `field_type` is not a natively msgpack'able type.
    Care should be taken to ensure that the encoded data can be decoded and
    usable in _another_ language other than Python to ensure future
    interoperability.

    The optional `decode` is any callable that takes the unpack'd encoded
    field value and returns the `field_type`. If you implement `encode`, you
    will probably always want to provide a `decode`.
